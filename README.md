## Genomic Data Retrieval with R

### Motivation:

This package is born out of my own frustration to automate the genomic data retrieval process to create computationally reproducible scripts for large-scale genomics studies. Since I couldn't find easy-to-use and fully reproducible software libraries I sat down and tried to implement a framework that would enable anyone to automate and standardize the genomic data retrieval process. I hope that this package is useful to others as well and that it helps to promote reproducible research in genomics studies.

I happily welcome anyone who wishes to contribute to this project :) Just drop me an email.

### Short package description:

The vastly growing number of sequenced genomes allows us to perform a new type of biological research.
Using a comparative approach these genomes provide us with new insights on how biological information is encoded 
on the molecular level and how this information changes over evolutionary time.

The first step, however, of any genome based study is to retrieve genomes and their annotation from databases. To automate the
retrieval process of this information on a meta-genomic scale, the `biomartr` package provides interface functions for genomic sequence retrieval and functional annotation retrieval. The major aim of `biomartr` is to facilitate computational reproducibility and large-scale handling of genomic data for (meta-)genomic analyses.
In addition, `biomartr` aims to address the `genome version crisis`. With `biomartr` users can now control and be informed 
about the genome versions they retrieve automatically. Many large scale genomics studies lack this information
and thus, reproducibility and data interpretation become nearly impossible when documentation of genome version information
gets neglected.

In detail, `biomartr` automates genome, proteome, CDS, RNA, Repeats, GFF/GTF (annotation), genome assembly quality, and metagenome project data retrieval from the major biological databases such as

- [NCBI RefSeq](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/)
- [NCBI Genbank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/)
- [ENSEMBL](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html)
- [ENSEMBLGENOMES](http://ensemblgenomes.org)
- [UniProt](http://www.uniprot.org)

Furthermore, an interface to the [Ensembl Biomart](www.ensembl.org/biomart) database allows users to retrieve functional annotation for genomic loci using a novel and organism centric search strategy. In addition, users can [download entire databases](https://github.com/HajkD/biomartr/blob/master/vignettes/Database_Retrieval.Rmd) such as `NCBI RefSeq`, `NCBI nr`, `NCBI nt`, `NCBI Genbank`, etc. as well as `ENSEMBL` and `ENSEMBLGENOMES` with only one command.

## Installation

```r
# install biomartr 0.8.0
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite('biomartr')
```

## Example

### Collection Retrieval

The automated retrieval of collections (= Genome, Proteome, CDS, RNA, GFF, Repeat Masker, AssemblyStats)
will make sure that the genome file of an organism will match the CDS, proteome, RNA, GFF, etc file
and was generated using the same genome assembly version. One aspect of why genomics studies
fail in computational and biological reproducibility is that it is not clear whether CDS, proteome, RNA, GFF, etc files
used in a proposed analysis were generated using the same genome assembly file denoting the same genome assembly version.
To avoid this seemingly trivial mistake we encourage users to retrieve
genome file collections using the `biomartr` function `getCollection()`
and attach the corresponding output as Supplementary Data
to the respective genomics study to ensure computational and biological reproducibility.


```r
# download collection for Saccharomyces cerevisiae
getCollection( db = "refseq", 
               organism = "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", 
               path = file.path("refseq","Collections"))
```

Internally, the `getCollection()` function will now generate a folder named `refseq/Collection/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae`
and will store all genome and annotation files for `Saccharomyces cerevisiae` in the same folder.
In addition, the exact genoem and annotation version will be logged in the `doc` folder.

Internally, a text file named `doc_Saccharomyces_cerevisiae_db_refseq.txt` is generated. The information stored in this log file is structured as follows:

```
File Name: Saccharomyces_cerevisiae_assembly_stats_refseq.txt
Organism Name: Saccharomyces_cerevisiae
Database: NCBI refseq
URL: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/000/146/045/GCF_000146045.2_R64/GCF_000146045.2_R64_assembly_stats.txt
Download_Date: Wed Jun 27 15:21:51 2018

version_status: latest

genome_rep: Full
seq_rel_date: 2014-12-17

```

In an ideal world this reference file could then be included as supplementary information in any
life science publication that relies on genomic information so that
reproducibility of experiments and analyses becomes achievable.


### Genome retrieval of hundreds of genomes using only one command

Download all mammalian vertebrate genomes from `NCBI RefSeq` via:

```r
# download all vertebrate genomes
meta.retrieval(kingdom = "vertebrate_mammalian", db = "refseq", type = "genome")
```
All geneomes are stored in the folder named according to the kingdom.
In this case `vertebrate_mammalian`. Alternatively, users can specify
the `out.folder` argument to define a custom output folder path.
