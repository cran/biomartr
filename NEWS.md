biomartr 0.1.0
===========

- fixing a parsing error of the file "ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/vertebrate_mammalian/assembly_summary.txt"
The problem was that comment lines were introduced and columns couldn't be parsed correctly anymore. This caused that genomes, proteomes, and CDS files could not be downloaded properly. This has been fixed now.

- genomes, proteome, and CDS as well as meta-genomes can now be retrieved
from RefSeq and Genbank (not only RefSeq); only `getCDS()` does not have genebank access,
becasue genbank does not provide CDS sequences

- adding new function `meta.retrieval()` to mass retrieve genomes for entire kingdoms of life 
- fixed a major bug in `organismBM()` causing the function to fail. The failure of
this function affected all downstream `organism*()` functions. Bug is now fixed and everything
works properly

- updated Vignettes

biomartr 0.0.3
